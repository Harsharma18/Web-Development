  <p class = "ars"> The word Java may sound familiar to coffee lovers and Geography teachers but in the IT world, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use with a reported 9 million developers. Not to be confused with Javascript, Java is known for its efficient processing speed in software, computer games and applications for both desktop and mobile. It is used to develop software and web-based applications for a variety of platforms and is very popular due to its ease of use for beginners though it can still take some time to master.

    Java was developed in 1995 by Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle) and is a programming language that is concurrent, class-based, objected oriented and is based on the syntax of C and C++.</p>
